# Install Instructions

1. Git clone the repository from Gitlab or from the public Github that will be created by Eric and Nick for their Winter work. Please contact them for access.
2. Once the repository is cloned, the required packages will need to be installed. This can be done by running npm install in the correct directory. For example, if the repository name was app_psychgames, that will be the repository that must be directed into before installing.

# Data Changes
Currently, the only data that is used or collected is in mongoDB. In order to access this information that is created throughout each research study with the correct results information, please contact Nick. 

Over the winter break, Nick will be creating a mechanism that will store the accepted prolific IDs in mongoDB. We envision Mel will be given access in order to add to the Collection with prolific IDs as more users will be using the application.
