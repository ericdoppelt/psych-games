# Install Instructions

1. Git clone the repository from Gitlab or from the public Github that will be created by Eric and Nick for their Winter work. Please contact them for access.
2. Once the repository is cloned, the required packages will need to be installed. This can be done by running npm install in the correct directory. For example, if the repository name was app_psychgames, that will be the repository that must be directed into before installing.

Code from Stackoverflow:
Our code repo contains some code we found on Stackoverflow with slight modification. All of them are covered under MIT License based on Stackoverflow's code contribution policy. More details can be found [here](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/271080/the-mit-license-clarity-on-using-code-on-stack-overflow-and-stack-exchange).

In addition, our package.json lists all of the versions of any library used in our application.

# Data Changes
Currently, the only data that is used or collected is in mongoDB. In order to access this information that is created throughout each research study with the correct results information, please contact Nick. 

Over the winter break, Nick will be creating a mechanism that will store the accepted prolific IDs in mongoDB. We envision Mel will be given access in order to add to the Collection with prolific IDs as more users will be using the application.

The tutorials placed into our app for Game 1 and Game 2 are readily accessible in order to change them. Currently, our client is updating the video for winter break, and it will be very easy to add in the frontend as long as it is the same file name as the current video.

In terms of data of the game, downloading data is done on the site UI. This will need to be updated to ensure only the correct parties can access it.
